# Topic
Truly, I believe one of the biggest crises we're facing in both the U.S. as well as accross the world is the mental health crisis. Protecting our mental health is essential to living a happy and healthy life, and, unfortuneately, people are suffering at significant rates, often without proper treatment.

As someone who has first-hand experience with anxiety, depression, and bipolar disorder, this topic is extremely important to me, as is spreading awareness of the prevalence of these issues.

Therefore, I wanted to find data for countries over time that contains measures such as:
- prevalence rates
- Burden of a disease/net effect on population
- existing treatments
