# Topic
Truly, I believe one of the biggest crises we're facing in both the U.S. as well as accross the world is the mental health crisis. Protecting our mental health is essential to living a happy and healthy life, and, unfortuneately, people are suffering at significant rates, often without proper treatment.

As someone who has first-hand experience with anxiety, depression, and bipolar disorder, this topic is extremely important to me, as is spreading awareness of the prevalence of these issues.

Therefore, I wanted to find data for countries over time that contains measures such as:
- prevalence rates
- Burden of a disease/net effect on population
- existing treatments

# Data
1. [Mental Health- Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/imtkaggleteam/mental-health?select=3-+adult-population-covered-in-primary-data-on-the-prevalence-of-major-depression.csv)

## Description
This data contains 7 different files:
1. **mental-illness-prevalence** (observation for each country for each year 1990-2019)
2. **burden-disease-from-each-mental-illness** (same granularity as above)
3. **adult-population-covered-...-on-the-prevalence-of-major-depression** (unsure about the wording here; data is by region instead of by country, and data only exists for 2008)
4. **adult-population-covered-...-on-the-prevalence-of-mental-illness** (unsure about the wording here; data is by region instead of by country, and data only exists for 2008)
5. **anxiety-disorders-treatment-gap** (has data for some countries, with one year of observation for each country; conditional upon having anxiety disorder, share of population receiving adequate vs inadequate treatment)
6. **depressive-symptoms-across-us-population** (zooming in on the US in 2014, deatils the frequencies of various depression symptoms for Americans with depression)
7. **number-of-countries-with-primary-data-on-prevalence-of-mental-illnesses-in-the-global-burden-of-disease-study** (in 2019, how many countries are keeping track of data related to ____ disorder? For example, there are 58 countries with primary data on alcohol use disorder, but only 2 countries with primary data on personality disorders)
